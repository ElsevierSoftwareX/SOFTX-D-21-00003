Based on NetFlow records collected on the Internet-facing interface of the AGH University of Science and Technology network during the consecutive period of 30 days.

Dormitories, populated with nearly 8000 students, generated 69% of the traffic. The rest of the university (over 4000 employees) generated 31%. In the case of dormitories, 91% of traffic was downstream traffic (from the Internet).
In the case of rest of the university, downstream traffic made up 73% of the total traffic. Therefore, this model can also be considered as representative of residential traffic.

In order to reproduce all steps towards fitting this model, please follow the [Makefile](Makefile).
